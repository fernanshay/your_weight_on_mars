# your_weight_on_mars
This is my first lines codes. I made a program to calculate your weight on Mars planet with 3 things (Html, nothing of Css and Javascript)
How I did it?

<strong>Html</strong>

First i learn how to code in html. Already i know i put a web title, <p> add some descriptions and that's all with html.</p>

Second, Javascript is the project key, because to know what's your weight on Mars or any planet we use rule of three math operation

<strong>Js?</strong>

Our Weight is very different in other planets because it depends by gravity force, making rule of three is easier to know that, 
just take your current weight (earth weight) variable, earth gravity data, any planet gravity data (what you want) and finally you have "X" currently your unknown viariable, but soon it'll be your weight in that Planet.

First you need to put <script> tag in your html or link any js file

After that, you'll create viarables from your data with 'var' | (var weight= 56) it's a expample ok?

finally make the rule of three, something like final_Weight= weight * g_mars / g_earth;

And you just show the result in a document.write("Your wight on Mars is " + final weight);
